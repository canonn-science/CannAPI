### 🙊 Intro

The Canonn API is designed to handle all our current science projects.

### 🚦 Current Status

This project is currently undergoing and an entire rewrite. If you are looking for the previous (currently in production) API source code, please see the [CAPIv2 repo](https://github.com/canonn-science/capiv2-strapi). Once this rewrite is complete, it will take over in place of the current API.

#### 🤔 Misc

TBD

### 🤔 Motivation

It has been some time since we have had a working API for some of the newest features in Elite Dangerous. The current API is a mess and is not easy to maintain. This project is an attempt to create a new API that is easy to maintain and extend.

### 💁 Contributing

I/We are actively looking for contributors, maintainers, and others to help shape this API. As this API service is built for the community, we want to make sure that it is as community driven as possible. If you are interested in helping out, please reach out to us on Discord.

You can reach out to the lead maintainer of this project directly on Discord at `@DMehaffy#1337`.

### ✋ Requirements

- Linux, MacOS, or Windows
- Git
- Node v16 or v18
- Yarn
- (Optional) PM2 for running this as a service
- MariaDB 10.5

### 📦 Installation & Configuration
